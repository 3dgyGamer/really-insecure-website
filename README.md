# REALLY INSECURE WEBSITE

#### What is it?

A website that contains numerous web vulnerabilities to help beginners practice. Each vulnerbilitity holds a "secret" 

Meant to be run locally, so please do not look into the code unless you are stuck or want to see how you can find signs of these vulnerabilities. 

#### Plans

Planning to have the OWASP top 10 stuff.
Maybe put it online

#### Updates

Updates will come when I want them to. Feel free to add your own vulnerability.
